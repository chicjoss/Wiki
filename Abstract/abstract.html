         Microplastics have been disrupting global ecosystems due to their resistance to degradation and frequency of consumption by organisms on all levels of the food chain. Much of the plastic that exists in the environment, particularly in the ocean, are tiny pieces on the nanoscopic scale. PETase is an enzyme discovered in the soil-dwelling organism Ideonella sakaiensis (I.s.;) it breaks down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. We have designed a cloning vector for the PETase gene by modifying the pAM4788 plasmid that is optimized for a cyanobacteria. The ultimate goal is to engineer a strain of marine cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus
    (S.e.,) which is able to digest PET plastic. Our team has also developed a method for
    assaying the eventual cyanobacteria by  preparing nanoparticles with fluorescein
    embedded so that fluorimetry can be used tomonitor the activity of the PETase enzyme.
