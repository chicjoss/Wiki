    <ol>
        <li>
           Dissolve 1 g of PET in 10 mL 90% v/v TFA and let sit overnight under constant stirring
            <ul>
                <li>NOTE: If the FischerSci PET granules were used an additional centrifugation step is needed as the granules contain 30 % glass
                reinforcer. After dissolution in 90 % TFA, separate the 10 mL solution into two glass centrifuge vials and centrifuge for 5 min at 2500 rpm. Glass particles
                should precipitate and the solution can be poured back into the flask as to not allow any of the glass particles to fall back in
            </li>
                    </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li>
            After letting sit overnight, add 100 μL of Fluorescein soln. (~ 0.05 g fluorescein dissolved in 1 mL dimethylsulfoxide) to the 10 mL solution
        </li>
       
       <li>Cover the solution with foil to protect fluorescence</li>
       <li>
           Setup dropper with 10 mL 20% v/v TFA and add dropwise to 90% TFA solution while the solution is still under constant stirring and let sit overnight
       </li>
       <li>
           Split the solution (now 20 mL of ~55 % TFA) into two plastic 50 mL centrifuge vials and dilute each vial to 50 mL with water
       </li>
       <li>
           Centrifuge for 0.5 hr at 5000 rpm and discharge supernatant
       </li>
       <li>
           Resuspend particles in 100 mL of 0.5 % SDS solution. (Add 25 mL water and 25 mL 1.0 % SDS to each vial and stir to resuspend particles. Combine both vials into a single beaker.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Sonicate the 0.5 % SDS solution at 35% for 0.5 hr. Beaker should be surrounded by ice water and the top should be covered in parafilm with the tip of the sonicator stabbed through the film.</li>
       <li>After sonication, place the solution in a graduated cylinder to allow larger particles to sink to the bottom of the solution. The graduated cylinder should be covered with foil to protect fluorescence.</li>
