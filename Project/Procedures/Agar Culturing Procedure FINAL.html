    <h3> Materials</h3>
    <h5><bold>For 30 petri dishes:</bold></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>500ml BG11</li>
        <li>15g agar mixed with 500ml of distilled water</li>
        <li>Autoclave both medias</li>
        <li>Once at 45-50C, add 3g Na2S2O3-5H2O to the agar solution</li>
        <li>Mix agar and BG11 and pour into plates</li>
        <p>Colonies take 2 weeks to mature</p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To make BG-11 agar plates, agar medium was first made. The concentrations from Table 7 were added
        to distilled water for a total of 500 mL. In a separate container, 15g of agar were added to 500
        of distilled water. After autoclaving both solutions, they were allowed to cool
        to 45-50°C. 3g Na2S2O3·5H2O, which served as a source of sulphur, was added to the agar solution.
        Next, both agar and liquid solutions were mixed together and quickly poured into 30 Petri plates,
        which 32 were left to cool</p>
    <p>
        To transfer microalgal colonies from agar, a wire loop was sterilized over a Bunsen burner flame 
        and allowed to cool before use. Once cooled, the loop was used to transfer a colony of cells 
        from one Petri plate to another and subsequently streaked across the plate into four quadrants, as
        shown in Figure 11. The time it took for cells to mature into colonies was about 2 weeks. 
        To ensure that the subcultures used as inoculum contained only S. elongatusmonoculture, 10 mL
        of BG-11 was inoculated with a single colony from the Petri plate. The colony was then allowed to
        mature into a culture growing in the exponential phase (96 hours after inoculation), and then used
        as seed culture for 100 mL medium.
