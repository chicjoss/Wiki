    One of the biggest problems that we currently face is the enormous amount of plastic 
        waste in the environment. These microplastics have disrupted global ecosystems due 
        to their resistance to degradation and unchallenged consumption by organisms at all 
        levels of the food chain. This problem is especially worrisome in the oceans where 
        over 600 species of marine life are negatively affected by microplastics in the ocean.

            Green Ocean’s aim is to genetically modify marine cyanobacteria that will enable it
            to degrade polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the most common form of plastic in the
            oceans. The engineered cyanobacteria harbor PETase, which is an enzyme that breaks down 
            PET. Our approach is novel because instead of using the traditional e. coli, which may 
            not survive in the ocean environment, cyanobacteria also known as “blue- green algae”
            are photosynthetic bacteria common in the ocean.

            We accomplished this by modifying the prototypical <i>Ideonella sakaiensis</i>  PETase gene 
            to be compatible with expression and secretion in cyanobateria. This engineering was
            accomplished in a dual-host plasmid shuttle vector in <i>E coli</i>, and then transferred to 
            a model cynaobacterium <i>Synechococus elongatus </i>  by conjugation.We also developed a PET 
            degradation assay system consisting of fluorescent PET nanoparticles. As the engineered
            cyanobacteria degraded the PET nanoparticles, the size change was measured by dynamic light
            scattering, fluorescent polarization imaging, and release of the fluorescent dye over time
            measured through a plate reader.

            As a team we are concerned of this world problem and our final goal is to have cleaner oceans
            in our environment.
