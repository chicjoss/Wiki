    <h3>Safety Training Access </h3>
    <p>
        Team members will all receive an IBC protocol included in the mandate Illinois Tech safety training,
        as well as project and lab specialize in training within a PI host lab.
        The team members will learn about topics in this IGEM through: Lab access rules, responsible individuals,
        good microbial technique, disinfection and sterilization, chemicals, fire and electrical safety.
        They will be working areas that have open benches if they are handing biological materials.
        The safety lab of our work space is BSL1.
    </p>
    <h5>Risk management </h5>
    <p>
        Personal protective equipment, access controls, accident reporting, waste management system,
        special procedures or protocols that address safety or security
    </p>
    <h5>Rules, training, containment</h5>
    <p>
        There are specific waste protocols in place for disposing of organic materials to ensure that there is no spread of contamination. Only those who have safety and lab training are allowed to be in the lab at any given time, and the PIs are always available to give answers when asked questions
        about protocol. Autoclaves are used for sterilization of waste material.
    </p>

    <h3>Goals </h3>
    <p>
        Our goal is to engineer an organism that will have a plasmid containing a gene that enables the organism to digest PET plastic. This organism will be developed from an cyanobacteria so that it can survive in aqueous
        environments in order to break down microplastics found in global water bodies.
    </p>
    <h3>Organisms</h3>
    <p>
        Escherichia coli, Synechococcus elongatus. Both of these are classified as BSL1 by the ATCC:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>S.e.: https://www.atcc.org/Products/All/33912.aspx </li>
        <li>E coli K12: https://www.atcc.org/products/all/25404.aspx </li>

    </ul>
    <p>Have been approved for use in this project by IIT IBC (institutional biosafety committee)</p>
    <h3>Risks of Organisms </h3>
    <p>No significant risks of the following organisms:</p>
    <h5>E coli K12</h5>
    <p>
        E coli K12 strains are a non-pathogenic variant of normal intestinal flora in healthy individuals, 
        and have  been extensively used in laboratories throughout the world specifically because they are
        not significantly dangerous.
    </p>
    <h5>S elongatus</h5>
    <p>
        S elongatus is a common environmental cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) that is found in waterways. 
        Indeed, many strains from the cyanobacteria repository we obtained it from. UTEX () were obtained 
        from environmental  water sources (although the type strain we are using was deposited).
        Cyanobacteria are free living non-pathogenic photosynthetic organisms already found
        in most environments.
    </p>
    <h3>Chasses in our IGEM </h3>
    <p>
        We will be using the following organism to chasses our project: Escherichia coli
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Risks of the Chasses </li>
        <p>
            E coli K12 strains are a non-pathogenic variant of normal intestinal flora in healthy individuals, and
            have  been extensively used in laboratories throughout the world specifically because they are not 
            significantly dangerous.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Experiments in our organisms </h3>
    <p>
        We will  modify an existing PETase (polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase) enzyme ( a plastic 
        degrading enzyme) to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be compatible with expression in cyanobacteria</li>
        <li>Will enhances its catalytic activity</li>
        <li>Be secreted in cyanobacteria</li>
        <li>Be easily detectable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Which will then allow us to clone it into a vector compatible with  expression  in out selected 
        cyanobacteria.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will then be evaluated in an assay where the degradation of plastic microparticles exposed
        to the experimental cyanobacteria will be measured by DLS or fluorescence
    </p>
    <h5>Risks associated </h5>
    <u>E coli K12</u>
    <p>
        E coli K12 strains are a non-pathogenic variant of normal intestinal flora in healthy individuals, 
        and have  been extensively used in laboratories throughout the world specifically because they are 
        not significantly dangerous.
    </p>
    <u>S elongatus</u>
    <p>
        S elongatus is a common environmental cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) that is found in waterways. 
        Indeed, many strains from the cyanobacteria repository we obtained it from. UTEX () were obtained
        from environmental  water sources (although the type strain we are using was deposited). Cyanobacteria
        are free living non-pathogenic photosynthetic organisms already found in most environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Risk due to  PETase also minimal as this enzyme already exists in a soil microorganism ( find a citation
        to this  - pubmed it).  Add a bit about this aspect too
    </p>
    <h3>Safety, security or ethical risks</h3>
    <p>
        Clearly there would be huge objection to introduction of GMOs in the environment.Below will give you an idea:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><bold>GMO argument:</bold> GMOs have largely been proved to be safe but there is still a lot of objection to them.
        So the fear is real even if unfounded and should be addressed</li>
        <li>
            <bold>Introduced species argument</bold> Is more of a real risk.there are many cases of humans screwing up an ecosystem by introducing a non-native species. And a few 
            cases of doing a good job and fixing a  problem well (less publicized due to the politics of the issue) </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Here is where the issue is more complex… we are not introducing a species.. Cyanobacteria were chosen 
        since they are already part of the environment.  And the GMO aspect is generally safe - it is the 
        interface of these two that this project addresses… si a PET eating Se ecologically disruptive when
        Se is not - and PET has already been introduced and is already disrupting the environment? Is fixing 
        a disruption, a disruption of its own?
    </p>
    <h3>Experts Overseeing our IGEM</h3>
    <p>
        The PIs of this project are two professors at our institution who have extensive experience with laboratory work and safety regulations. They ensure that the proper protocols are being followed and that only those individuals trained to be in the laboratory are performing experiments.
        The project has been further submitted and approved by IIT’s IBC (institution biosafety committee)
    </p>
    <h3>Rules/ Guidance </h3>
    <p>
        Clear regulations on disposal of organic material, especially E. coli.
        We are following protocol approved by Illinois Tech’s IBC. these were based on the CDC’s 
        recommended practiced for BSL 1 laboratories  as set out in Biosafety in Microbiological and
        Biomedical Laboratories - CDC
