        In March 2019, a whale washed up ashore in the Philippines with 88 lbs. of plastic in its stomach
        (National Geographic). Plastic is composed of large molecules called polymers which are highly 
        stable, making plastic resistant to degradation. Plastic accumulates in the bodies of organisms that accidentally consume it and magnifies in concentration as you move up the food chain. As a result, plastic can be found in the bodies of humans as well. PETase was discovered in a bacteria that lives on land rather than in aquatic environments. Our aim is to bring that enzyme to the oceans where between 5 and 12 billion tonnes of plastic end up every year.
        To start, a plasmid that was optimized for cyanobacteria was designed to serve as the vector for 
        the PETase gene that codes for the enzyme that catabolizes PET. To construct the plasmid, smaller
        fragments of the plasmid were amplified individually with PCR. Primers were designed for the 
        amplification of smaller regions of the entire plasmid because it is difficult if not impossible
        to amplify fragments above a certain size. These fragments were then verified for length using gel 
        electrophoresis after amplification. Then, the fragments were purified with the purity and 
        concentration tested with spectrophotometry. After  synthesizing the correct fragments a Gibson
        assembly reaction was performed to mend the pieces of the plasmid together. Then, the plasmids can 
        be transformed into Escherichia coli which can donate the genetic material to the cyanobacteria.
